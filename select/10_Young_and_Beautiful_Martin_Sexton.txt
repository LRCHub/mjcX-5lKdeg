Young and beautiful
Say what was your name
Taken by the clothes you wear
And the games that you play
Black leather jacket and high heel boots
I see you out on the scene
Know how to party and play the part
Of a rock and roll queen
Yes you do
Oh but young and beautiful
Where is the love that you had as a
Young and beautiful
Sent from heaven above you were so free and
Young and beautiful
Tell me now where is the pride that you hide so deep inside
Do you hide it away for a rainy day
Through my green eyes of envy
With a gut wrenching greed
I place you out on a pedestal
Then I planted my seed, my love
Out on Melrose Ave
Out on Newbury Street
Young and beautiful
Where is the love that you had as a
Young and beautiful
Sent from heaven above you were so free and wild
Young and beautiful
Tell me where is the child that you hide so deep inside
Does she hide away for some rainy day
In my dreams last night you were a scared little child
Perfection and grace held your big disguise
It was draped on the bedpost there
Beside your empty glass
And the silence held the lock tight on the door
Kept you safe from the world anymore
Is it all just a game that you play
To be so young and beautiful
So young and beautiful
You're so young and so beautiful
I hear the clock tick tock, tick tock, ticking and tocking away
So young and beautiful baby and so fine
Your so young and beautiful, and you're so fine
And everyone knows that only in my dreams
Are you ever gonna be mine
So young and beautiful baby and so fine
